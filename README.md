# Learning Bazel

[Vorburger](http://www.vorburger.ch) learns [Bazel](https://bazel.build) here.

This repo is organized by folder, each of which has its own README. There is intentionally no `WORKSPACE` file in the root directory.

Install [Bazelisk](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk), e.g. using `go install github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk@latest` (or e.g. with [eget](https://github.com/zyedidia/eget), or however else you prefer), and `alias b` it. All other required tools for building and testig will then be  automatically downloaded as needed.
